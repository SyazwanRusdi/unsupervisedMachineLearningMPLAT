## Project Details


IDE Python: Jupiter from Anaconda

The objectives of this project are 
identifying the features essential for speech disorder diagnosis, determining the pattern of 
subgroup based on the dataset by using clustering algorithms, and evaluating clustering 
algorithms. 

For this project, we start with selection features. We select features based on correlation 
between two features and variance. After that, we use K-means and hierarchical clustering to 
find optimal number of clusters and dividing data into several cluster. Finally, we evaluate 
clustering methods by using silhouette coefficient, Dunn index and Davies Bouldin index
